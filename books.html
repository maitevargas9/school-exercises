                Harry Potter is a series of seven fantasy novels written by British author J. K. Rowling. The novels chronicle the lives
                of a young wizard, Harry Potter, and his friends Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley, all of whom are students at Hogwarts
                School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. The main story arc concerns Harry's conflict with Lord Voldemort, a dark wizard who
                intends to become immortal, overthrow the wizard governing body known as the Ministry of Magic, and subjugate all
                wizards and Muggles (non-magical people).
